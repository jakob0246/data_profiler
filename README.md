# **Usage**
Run project with PyCharm and Python 3.6. For that, create a new PyCharm project for the _data_profiler_. Then install required libraries, as well. Execute _Main.py_ if you want to obtain metadata from a dataset. The first 6 variables within the main function serve as the input-parameters.

# Datasets
Exemplary datasets are obtained from the UCI machine learning repository.
